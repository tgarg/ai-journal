# Context
Research has shown that people that self-reflect on a regular basis have better awareness of their thoughts, develop stronger emotional intelligence, make better decisions, and live lives more closely matched with their values. Despite clear consensus on benefits, implementing a fruitful self-reflection practice can be challenging. Many begin journaling digitally or on paper, but without external feedback highlighting key themes or patterns, it can lack direction. While some seek journaling methods or prompts online, these generic questions fail to resonate with their personal experiences.

# Product Objective
Help our users develop consistent self-reflection practices that increase self-awareness, improve decision-making, and help them live life in ways that resonate deeply.

# Project Objectives
- Help the novice developer understand technical decisions and tradeoffs involved in building AI powered applications
- Help the novice developer learn about knowledge graphs and personalized AI systems.
- Help the novice developer demonstrate product management skills in AI product development

# Core User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to create journal entries
- As a user I want to be able to edit existing journal entries
- As a user I want to be able to see a history of past journal entries
- As a user I want to be able to ask the AI for analysis or prompts as I write a journal entry
- As a user I want to be able to open a chat interface with the AI from a journal entry
- As a user I want to be able to open a chat interface with the AI from the home page
- As a user I want the AI to develop memory about my life including people, challenges, goals, intentions, insights, emotions, and locations.
- As a user I want the AI to be able to identify patterns and connections between my thoughts over time

# Technical Considerations
- Allow for local LLM usage using Ollama during development and testing, Claude API as the project advances
- Build unit tests as you go
- Build evals for LLM outputs
- Modularize the code where possible
